# Portfolio

This website is designed as a store would be :
- Front-Office: where people can browse the articles and discover new things. Here, it's where people can read my blog posts and check the project I'm currently working.
- Door: where the staff can authenticate to access the back-office. Here, it's the pages `/login` and `/sign-up` where you can create an account and log to yours to access the back-office.
- Back-Office: where staff can manage their tasks, notes, calendar, etc. Here, it's my personalized productivity system where I manage all my tasks, notes and projects. Anyone can create an account because the final goal of this project is to get public, but as I'm still working on it daily, it's still in alpha version. There might be bugs, problems, data errors, things like that, so it shouldn't be your only productivity system.
