I’m a software developer, and like many of my peers, I build software around my interests. I had a problem with managing my shopping lists, so I built [wisecart.app](https://www.wisecart.app). I also develop applications with the same foundation, so I built [my boilerplate](https://boilerplate.maximeduhamel.com). Since the beginning of 2025, I’ve been posting videos on YouTube. As I move toward making more scripted videos, I needed a tool to improve my scripts, so my next startup focuses on that. However, I’m facing a challenge. I’m not the most skilled software developer, so if I’m building an application for development, it might not be as polished as what others are creating. So, what subject should I focus on when making software?

# This is a common problem

When you watch Marc Louvion for example, he is building applications for developpers : [datafast](https://datafa.st), [shipfast](https://shipfa.st), ... And he is having quite a lof of success. But this success seems to be coming from a really good product-market fit with [shipfast](https://shipfa.st) that built his personal brand and his community, and now, whatever he puts out, his community will make it a relative success.

But when you look at his apps, they are pretty good, but they are in a very competitive field. [Datafast](https://datafa.st) compete with [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), [Google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), and a lot of other good analytics softwares. It's very very difficult to make an application that stands out.

# A way to solve this problem

A lot of areas like finances, sports, or productivity for example where any software developer can build an app useful for anyone. Take for example [finary](https://finary.com/), an app for your finances, seems to be a great and refreshing app. I have never seen an app for finances that was interesting like this one, I don't have a subscription for Finary but if I wanted to take a subscription to improve my finances, this is the one I would go to. And this is because of their personal branding on YouTube.

# What I will do now

So now, my goal is to bring my software development skill to areas where there a very low competition to take a big step in these areas and make a difference. Some of these areas could be dressing, nutrition, productivyity, motivation, personal management, ... This is a new motivation for me, and I'm really happy. My goal is still to solve my own problems, so that's it's useful for me at least.
