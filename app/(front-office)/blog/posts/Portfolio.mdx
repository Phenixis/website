summary: My portfolio, and it's mysterious backend application...

You are currently on my portfolio, where I write about my projects and I share my thoughts. But you are on the frontend of the website, but there is also a backend application. Let me explain:

## The frontend

So, the frontend is a simple website where you can learn more about me, my projects and my thoughts. It's built with NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript and SEO-optimized. It's hosted on Vercel, and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Phenixi/portfolio).

But this is not the subject, let's dive in the backend of this website !

## The backend

I had this idea in early March, I wanted to build my own system to manage my tasks, my projects, my calendar and more. I've been using Obsidian for a long time, and I love it, but it was hard to keep track of my current tasks. So I decided to build my own system, and I've been working on it since.

The first module was a task manager, but with a twist: it's based on the Eisenhower Matrix. If you don't know what it is, it's a time management method that helps you prioritize your tasks based on their urgency and importance. Here is the matrix:

So, when I create a task, I rate the importance of the task out of 5 and I set a due date. Then, every day, the system updates the task's urgency based on the due date: the closer the date, the more urgent the task is. And then, on a dashboard, I see all my tasks sorted by a score, which is the product of the importance and the urgency.

Then, I kept working on it, I shared it with my friends, and I'm thinking about publishing it. We don't know what the future holds.
