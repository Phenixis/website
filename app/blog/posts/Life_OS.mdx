It all started in the back-office of my portfolio...

## The first idea

I wanted to build a system to manage my tasks and my projects. So I created a hidden page in my portfolio (this website you are on), and a simple task manager based on the Eisenhower Matrix:

<center>![Eisenhower Matrix](https://s1.qwant.com/thumbr/474x486/1/8/61a8d7449e994fadbaa9b489d4540e8e14c3535f89fe7b3fbbab66dc37f700/th.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.5NBPIUL2j9mena4jq2w35AHaHm%26pid%3DApi&q=0&b=1&p=0&a=0)</center>

This matrix helps me prioritize my tasks based on their urgency and importance. I set a due date for each task, and the system updates the urgency every day based on how close the due date is. I could then see all my tasks intelligently sorted.

I also added a calender to see my tasks and events at a glance, a note manager to write down my ideas and thoughts, a movie tracker to keep track of the movies I watched and want to watch, and more and more features.

But then I realized that the system I built can be useful for others too. So, I build a brand around it, based on my situation : a student that want a centralized system to manage my life, not 36 different apps and websites, and I called it "Life OS".

## The first version

The first version is currently in building. I am working on it every day, implementing the different plans and required features to launch the app in production officialy.

While I'm building it, I'm streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/maximeduhamel) my working sessions to share my progress and get feedback from the community. If you're interested in following the development, feel free to come and join the chat!
