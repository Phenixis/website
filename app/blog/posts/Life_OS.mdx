## The problem

I've been using a lot of different apps and websites to manage every aspects of my life : tasks, projects, notes, calendar, movies to watch, books to read, habits to build, expenses to track, and more. I started by using [Notion](https://www.notion.com/), a web app where you can write notes, have datatable, tasks, etc... but it was always slow on my devices and I felt quickly limited by its features. To be honest, it was 2 or 3 years ago, so maybe it was optimized and improved, so take my opinion with a grain of salt because it may be outdated.

Then, I tried another app : [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), an application based on local markdown files focusing on [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). It was very good, the application was fast, empowered by great community plugins, so every problem I had with Notion was solved, but I faced other problems:
- files were only local, so synchronizing across devices was a *real* mess (until I discovered Obsidian Sync, but I still feel that 60$/year is a lot *just* for this feature)
- You can't centralize your data, even when using the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin, it felt really limited. One example of this is that I wanted to be able to have every todo I wrote in one note, but it was impossible to do so without writing a lot of complex queries, and there was no sorting, no filtering, etc...

What I really wanted at the time was to have one place where I could find every running project and task. So I thought "Why not build it myself?".

## The first idea

With that in mind, I created a hidden page in my portfolio (this website you are on), and a simple task manager based on the Eisenhower Matrix:

This matrix helps me prioritize my tasks based on their urgency and importance. I set a due date for each task, and the system updates the urgency every day based on how close the due date is. I could then see all my tasks intelligently sorted. Here is a screenshot of the current version:

In the metadata, you can see the importance, due date, and the estimated duration for each task. A formula calculates a score based on these values, and all tasks are sorted accordingly, so the most important and urgent tasks appear at the top. In addition, if a task's due date is in less than three days, its background turns orange.

I loved so much building this simple task manager that I kept going with other features I wanted: a note manager to write down my ideas and thoughts, a movie tracker to keep track of the movies and series I watched and want to watch, an AI chat based on configurable profiles to help me with my work, etc...

Time went by, and as I talked about this project with my friends and family, I realized that this system could be useful for others too. So, I build a brand around it, based on my situation : a student that want a centralized system to manage my life, not 36 different apps and websites, and I called it "Life OS", for "Life Operating System".

## The first version

The first version is currently in building. I am working very hard on it every day to make sure the app is perfect.

While I'm building it, I'm streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/maximeduhamel) my working sessions to share my progress and get feedback from the community. If you're interested in following the development, feel free to come and join the chat!
