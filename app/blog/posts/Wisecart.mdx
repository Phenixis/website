This is a special project for me. I worked on this app between September 2024 and December 2024, to help me with my shopping list.

As I explained in [this blog post](/blog/how_I-got-into-indie-hacking), I had just discovered the world of indie hacking and I wanted to create my first app. I had no idea of what to build, so I looked into my own problem. I quickly realised I was tired of forgetting items when I was doing my shopping and having no idea what to cook for dinner, so I got my idea.

To turn this idea into a real app, I learned NextJS, TailwindCSS, React and everything necessary. I was so excited about this project that I worked on it every day before and after uni. I loved working on the same project daily, being able to see the evolution from an idea to something that doesn't work to something that does work. 

In the mid-October, I discovered the boilerplate from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) called ["SaaS Starter"](https://vercel.com/templates/authentication/next-js-saas-starter), and it implemented everything I needed to make this app something serious, so I took a big decision...

I forked the boilerplate's repo, built the app again, with the inspiration of the first version I had make in the past few weeks, and adapted it to the boilerplate. It took me a while to understand the boilerplate completely and learn how it worked, but in early December, I had a working version available for all at [wisecart.app](https://wisecart.app/).

Now... For a first app, it's great, but honestyl the app itself is really bad. I checked the website just now, and listed some problems:
- The width is not good, a bit too wide, which means you can scroll horizontally
- There is a loading state to access the landing page, which is bad for SEO and for the User Experience generally
- The landing page feels flat
- The design choices are discutable
- ...

I'm not saying just for the pleasure of stating what I did wrong, but to state that even if I know it was bad, I did and it solved my problem. I've stopped using the app for a while *(keep reading to understand why)* but it was useful at the time and I was generally so happy to use it because it was my own app, my little baby.

As you understood, the app is discontinued. In September 2025, the app will get closed, the project will still be available as a subdomain of this portfolio for posterity. The main reason for this stop is that there is an better version of Wisecart in [Life OS](/blog/Life-OS), my Personal Productivity System.
