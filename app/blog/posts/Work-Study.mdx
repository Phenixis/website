Nutraveris is a consulting and software company that helps businesses in the nutrition and health industries to market dietary supplements. Since September 2025, I work in there the IT department, as a Junior Developer alternating between periods of study at the university and working at the company, on-site.

This program has been created by the Government to help students to get a job, real-world experience and money to finance the studies and companies to find workforce cheaper than full-time employees and train students on their technos and methods. It's a win-win situation.

## How it started

In May 2025, I was in Cardiff for a 3-month internship to fulfill the 2nd year requirement of my Computer Science degree, and one of the professor reached to the students to remind them that some work-study offers made by companies to the university had no applicants. I wasnâ€™t sure if I wanted to do my 3rd year in this work-study program (since it has some drawbacks), so I only looked at the offers vaguely but one stood out. 

The company was looking for a web developer *(what I love)* with knowledge on modern technos *(which I had)*, for a 1 year contract *(the duration I wanted)*, in the nearest city of my parents' house *(which was perfect)*. I thought :
> "Well, this is for me. It matches everything I want and there are no applicant ? Let's apply RIGHT NOW"
