October 25th, 2025: it's Saturday, I wake up from a good night of sleep and I have one idea in mind: "It's time to launch Life OS."

If you don't know what Life OS is, you can read the story behind this application right [here](/blog/life-os). Long story short, it's an application I started building for myself in early 2025 because I couldn't find a productivity system working for me. I started talking about it with my friends and family and soon I wanted to make it publicly available if someone was interested in the same kind of system.

So I kept building it, I wanted to make it perfect, so I fixed that, added this feature and this new thing absolutely necessary for the app and soon, without realizing it, we were 1 year later, the app changed **a lot** and it wasn't public yet.

And this Saturday morning, I woke up and I knew it was time to fix as much bugs as I can, write my Product Hunt description and get the load off my shoulders. I worked all day long, and at the end of the day, it was ready.
